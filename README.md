# GrubDash
Thinkful React app project

I've been hired as a backend developer for a new startup called GrubDash! As another developer works on the design and frontend experience, I have been tasked with setting up an API and building out specific routes so that the frontend developers can demo some initial design ideas for the big bosses.

This project shows my ability to build APIs with complex validation. I am comfortable with the learning objectives listed below:

Running tests from the command line
Using common middleware packages
Receiving requests through routes
Accessing relevant information through route parameters
Building an API following RESTful design principles
Writing custom middleware functions

Frontend code is in the starter-grubdash repo.
